# Resume-analyzer

The python script is to analyze freqeuncies and importance of words in a resume. We cannot put many words in a one-page resume. As a job-seeker, it is critical to know what key words you resume delivers and whether they match job descriptions.

The script inputs your resume in the txt format. Word cloud and bar charts are generated to show your strengths!

Techically, the script uses the word-cloud package developed by Adnreas Mueller. Here are links to the doc and his github https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/ https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud

Credits also go to IBM-Data-Visualization Course on Coursera.
